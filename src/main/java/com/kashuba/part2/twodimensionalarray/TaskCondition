There is a two-dimensional array:

String[][] s = {{"Miko≈Çaj", "10"}, {"Sonia", "53"}, {"Kiryl", "30"}, {"Sonia","40"}, {"Hubert","80"}, {"Kiryl", "4"}};
Which represents the number of commits made in a month in the company.

Write code that calculates the average number of commits for each person and presents them as a list in descending order.
