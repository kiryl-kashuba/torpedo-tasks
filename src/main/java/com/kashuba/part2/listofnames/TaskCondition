You have a list of names:
List<String> names = List.of("Anna", "Bartek", "Celina", "Adam", "Aga", "Filip");

Do the following:
1. Use Predicate<String> to select names starting with "A".
2. Use Function<String, String> to change them to "Name: XYZ" in uppercase.
3. Collect the result into a list.
4. If the list is not empty – use Consumer<String> to print each one.
5. If the list is empty – use Optional and print "No results".
